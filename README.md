The Net Banking or online banking is a system which is used by millions of peoples 
around the globe. Through the project we try to provide an interface where every 
bank customer can use the banking facility without going to the bank. Each user can 
register himself on the website which will create his own account and profile where 
he can select his account type and can transfer funds.

1. Admin
2. Employees of the bank
3. Customers
